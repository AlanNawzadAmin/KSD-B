This code includes code necessary to reproduce part of Fig. 1 of the accompanying submission.
The notebook ``KSD-B theory example.ipynb'' will reproduce Fig. 1 A and B for the kernels IMQ-H (N), IMQ-H (U), and IMQ-H+Exp-H.
To run this code, one requires at least python version 3.6 with an up to date version of numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
